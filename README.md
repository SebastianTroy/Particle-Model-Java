Particle-Model-Java
===================

To download a runnable & stable version of the program <a href ="https://github.com/SebastianTroy/Particle-Model-Java/raw/master/Particle-Model-Java/Model.jar">click here<a>.

This model represents the Java version of the model I worked on for my dissertation.

In the main model, use the '-' key to zoom out and the '=' key to zoom in. Also the arrow keys can be used to adjust the tilt of the view.

In the Vectorfield Tester, click and drag the mouse to induce water currents in the vector field, and use the 'a' key to toggle the arrow heads on and off. The minimum value for 'Linear Interpolation', while maintaining realistic flow patterns is 6, however 20 results in the most realistic flow. It may be necessary to reduct the value to 1 in order to get a decent framerate on some machines.
